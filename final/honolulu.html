        Honolulu brings together high-rise hotels, local neighborhoods, and classic viewpoints like Diamond Head.
        From the summit, you can see Waikiki, Ala Moana, and the long curve of shoreline that shapes the city.

        The photo below is taken from the top of Diamond Head, where many visitors lean on the railing and
        look down at the city. It captures the feeling of being above everything while still close to the ocean.

          <h3>Diamond Head (Lē‘ahi)</h3>
          <p>
            The trail up Diamond Head is short but steep, with stairs, switchbacks, and tunnels. When you reach the top,
            you can see how the city curves around the coastline. It’s one of the best places to understand the shape
            of Honolulu in a single glance.

          <h3>Connecting Waikiki &amp; Ala Moana</h3>
          <p>
            After the hike, many people head down into Waikiki or over to Ala Moana Beach Park. Both spots offer places
            to swim, relax, and grab food within walking distance or a short bus ride from the trail.
          </p>
          <p>
            A simple plan is: hike in the morning, eat lunch in Waikiki, and then watch the sunset from Ala Moana.
            That one loop gives you exercise, city energy, and a calm ending to the day.

          <strong>Honolulu Tips</strong>
          <p>
            Honolulu can be busy, so starting early helps avoid heat and crowds. Bringing water, sunscreen, and patience
            makes it easier to enjoy both the hikes and the city streets.

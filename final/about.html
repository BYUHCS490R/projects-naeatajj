  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
   Tonga Footprint Portraits began as a simple family hobby that slowly grew into something much bigger. We started by taking photos for our own family—graduations, birthdays, and church events. Over time, more relatives and friends asked if we could take their pictures too. What began as helping out our kāinga turned into a small family photography service. We enjoy capturing real moments, natural smiles, and the warm island light that makes every photo feel alive. Our family works together in each session, whether it’s posing a large group, helping kids feel comfortable, or making sure everyone looks their best. One of our first real sessions was with an extended family gathered on the lawn, and seeing how happy they were with the photos made us realize we wanted to keep doing this. Tonga Footprint Portraits grew from those early experiences, and it continues to be a way for our family to celebrate culture, connection, and ʻofa through photography.

  <p>
    Many of our sessions are held outdoors, using the natural island light to create warm, genuine images. Families laugh, talk, and sometimes dance while we shoot, and we keep the atmosphere relaxed so they stay comfortable and natural.

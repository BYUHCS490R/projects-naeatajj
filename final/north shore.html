      <p class="content-intro">
        On the North Shore, huge winter waves and calm summer days share the same shoreline. My friends and I often
        head to Waimea and the surrounding beaches to swim, explore, and just enjoy being together.
      </p>
      <p class="content-intro">
        The photos and description below show one way to spend a relaxed day on the North Shore: hiking to Waimea Falls,
        swimming in the pool, and then stopping by nearby beaches to watch the surf.

          <h3>Waimea Valley &amp; Falls</h3>
          <p>
            Waimea Valley combines culture, history, and nature. The path to the waterfall passes through a botanical
            garden and historic sites. At the end of the walk, you reach the pool where you can put on a life jacket
            and swim up close to the falls.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the photo, you can see us geared up and ready to swim. Being in the cool water surrounded by thick green
            plants feels completely different from the dry road you arrive on. It’s a good reminder that North Shore is
            not only about the ocean—it also has valleys that feel like a different world.

          <h3>Nearby Beaches</h3>
          <p>
            After Waimea Falls, we usually head down to Waimea Bay or Sunset Beach. On calmer days we swim and jump from
            the rock at Waimea (when conditions allow). On big-wave days, we stay on the sand and watch experienced
            surfers instead.

          <strong>Safety Reminder</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Always listen to lifeguards and obey posted signs at the bay and the falls.</li>
            <li>Use the required life jacket when swimming at Waimea Falls.</li>
            <li>If the shorebreak looks heavy or crowded, enjoy the view from a safe distance.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These simple steps keep the adventure fun and help everyone go home with good memories instead of injuries.

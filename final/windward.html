      <p class="content-intro">
        The Windward Side collects clouds and rain, which keep the mountains bright green. One of my favorite ways to
        appreciate this side of the island is hiking up to a ridge where you can see both the shoreline and the deep valleys.
      </p>
      <p class="content-intro">
        The photo on this page is from one of those ridge hikes. The climb is not always easy, but sharing the view with
        friends at the top makes the effort worth it.

          <h3>On the Trail</h3>
          <p>
            Many Windward hikes start in the trees and then suddenly open up to reveal the coastline. As you climb,
            you can look back and watch the neighborhoods grow smaller while the ocean stretches out in different shades
            of blue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hiking with friends makes the climb feel shorter. We usually take breaks at viewpoints, laugh about how
            steep certain sections are, and encourage each other to keep going when our legs start to complain.

          <h3>Respecting the Area</h3>
          <p>
            Ridge trails often pass near neighborhoods and sometimes cross areas that are culturally important.
            We try to keep our voices down early in the morning, stay on marked paths, and carry out all our trash.

          <strong>Windward Hiking Tips</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Check the weather; ridges can be muddy or slippery after rain.</li>
            <li>Wear proper shoes and bring water instead of hiking in slippers.</li>
            <li>Park legally and avoid blocking driveways or narrow roads.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Taking care of simple details like these allows everyone to keep enjoying these trails in the future.

      <p>
        Nestled along Oahuâ€™s North Shore, Laie is a place where island culture and spirituality come together beautifully. 
        The town is surrounded by turquoise waves, lush mountains, and friendly faces that make every visitor feel at home. 
        Itâ€™s a reminder that true paradise isnâ€™t just about sceneryâ€”itâ€™s about connection, peace, and gratitude.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether youâ€™re walking through temple gardens or relaxing at Hukilau Beach, Laie offers a feeling of calm that stays with you. 
        The sunsets here are unforgettable, painting the sky with gold and crimson light. 
        Laie reminds me that adventure can be quiet and meaningful, found in every moment we take to breathe and appreciate the beauty around us.

        <h4>What did you learn about Flex and CSS?</h4>
        <p>
          I learned that CSS Flexbox is a layout tool that helps organize items easily across a web page.
          It allows elements to adjust their size and position automatically to fit different screen sizes.
          Flex helps create modern, responsive designs without needing floats or complicated positioning.
          CSS also controls how content looks â€” including fonts, colors, spacing, and alignment.
        </p>

      <div class="question">
        <h4>Why is Flexbox useful?</h4>
        <p>
          Flexbox is useful because it makes it easy to center content, create equal spacing, and align
          items in both rows and columns. It simplifies web layouts, especially for navigation bars,
          galleries, and sections that need to adjust automatically on different devices.

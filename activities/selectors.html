        <p>What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</p>
        <p>In CSS, an ID (#id) is unique and should be used for styling a single element on a page, while a Class (.class) is reusable and can be applied to multiple elements. IDs have higher specificity than classes, meaning their styles override class styles if both are applied. In practice, use IDs for unique elements (like a header or footer) and classes for groups of elements that share the same styling (like buttons or text highlights).</p>

        <p>What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag?</p>
        <p>The main difference between a span and a div is that span is an inline element used to style or group small parts of text within a line, while div is a block-level element used to group larger sections of content or layout elements. A div starts on a new line and takes up the full width available, whereas a span stays inline with surrounding text. In short, use span for styling specific words or phrases inside text, and div for structuring or dividing larger blocks of content.</p>
        
        <p>What is the difference between a DIV tag and a HEADER, MAIN, or FOOTER?</p>
        <p>A div is just a plain box used to group content without saying what that content means, while header, main, and footer are special HTML tags that describe the role of the content inside themâ€”like the top section, the main part of the page, or the bottom section. Using these semantic tags makes your code easier to understand, better for accessibility tools like screen readers, and more helpful for search engines.</p>

        <p>What are the different ways to select a color?</p>
        <p>In CSS, you can select colors in several ways: by using named colors (like red or blue), hex codes (e.g., #ff0000), RGB or RGBA values for red, green, blue, and optional transparency, HSL or HSLA values for hue, saturation, lightness, and optional transparency, or special keywords like transparent and currentColor.</p>

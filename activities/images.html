    <h3>QUESTIONS</h3>
    <h3>What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</h3>
    <p>JPEG works best for photographs and images with many colors, gradients, and fine details (like landscapes, portraits, or complex scenes). It uses lossy compression, which reduces file size significantly but may slightly lower quality.</p>

    <h3>What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</h3>
    <p>GIF is good for simple graphics with limited colors, such as logos, icons, line art, or small animations. It supports only 256 colors but allows transparency and basic animation.</p>

    <h3>What is unique about the PNG format?</h3>
    <p>PNG uses lossless compression (no quality loss). It supports millions of colors, sharp details, and transparent backgrounds with alpha channels (smooth transparency). Itâ€™s ideal for logos, web graphics, and images that require high quality with transparency.</p>

    <h3>How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</h3>
    <p>Use photo editing software (like Photoshop, GIMP, or online editors) to scale it to the exact pixel dimensions you need. This ensures the file size is optimized and matches its display dimensions.</p>

    <h3>Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS? </h3>
    <p>Resizing in CSS only shrinks how it looks on screen but does not reduce file size.

The browser still loads the full, large image, which slows down page load speed and wastes bandwidth. Editing software actually reduces the image dimensions and compresses the file, making it faster and more efficient.</p>

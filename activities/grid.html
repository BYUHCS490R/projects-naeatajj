        Nestled along Oahuâ€™s North Shore, Laie is a place where island culture and spirituality come together beautifully. 
        The town is surrounded by turquoise waves, lush mountains, and friendly faces that make every visitor feel at home. 
        Itâ€™s a reminder that true paradise isnâ€™t just about sceneryâ€”itâ€™s about connection, peace, and gratitude.

        Whether youâ€™re walking through temple gardens or relaxing at Hukilau Beach, Laie offers a feeling of calm that stays with you. 
        The sunsets here are unforgettable, painting the sky with gold and crimson light. 
        Laie reminds me that adventure can be quiet and meaningful, found in every moment we take to breathe and appreciate the beauty around us.

            <h4>1. What is the parent-child relationship in HTML, and why is it important in Flex and Grid?</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              In HTML, the parent-child relationship describes how elements are nested. 
              The <strong>parent</strong> element contains other elements, and those inside it are the <strong>children</strong>. 
              This structure is essential when using <strong>Flexbox</strong> and <strong>Grid</strong> because the parent controls the layout behavior 
              (for example, `display: flex` or `display: grid`), while the children become flexible or grid items that respond to those layout rules.
            </p>

          <div class="question">
            <h4>2. What are the two main differences between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              The first main difference is that <strong>Flexbox</strong> is a <em>one-dimensional</em> layout systemâ€”it arranges items in a row or a column.  
              <strong>CSS Grid</strong>, on the other hand, is a <em>two-dimensional</em> system, allowing control of both rows and columns at the same time.  
              Secondly, Flexbox is best for aligning content within a single line, while Grid is best for creating full page or section layouts.

        <p>What is normal flow in HTML?</p>
        <p>Normal flow is the default way that elements are arranged on a webpage before any CSS positioning is applied. In normal flow, block elements such as div or p are stacked vertically from top to bottom, while inline elements such as span or a appear next to each other horizontally. This natural order is how browsers display content by default.</p>


        <p>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</p>
        <p>The float property in CSS allows an element to move to the left or right side of its container, letting text and other inline elements wrap around it. It is often used for layouts that include images or sidebars. You need to clear the float to prevent other elements from wrapping around the floated item and to make sure that elements below it start on a new line, maintaining the proper layout of the page.</p>


        <p>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</p>
        <p>The relative, absolute, and fixed properties are different types of positioning in CSS. Relative positioning moves an element slightly from its normal position without removing it from the flow of the page. Absolute positioning removes an element from the normal flow and places it exactly where you want it, based on its nearest positioned ancestor. Fixed positioning keeps an element in the same place on the screen even when the user scrolls, such as with sticky navigation bars or buttons.</p>


        <p>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</p>
        <p>You can make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices by using CSS to style them with padding, rounded corners, and easy-to-tap sizes. Using tools like Flexbox helps make the buttons align neatly, and media queries can adjust the design to fit smaller screens. You can also use frameworks like Bootstrap to create responsive, mobile-friendly navigation bars quickly and easily.</p>


        <p>Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</p>
        <p>You can find videos to review class topics on your schools online learning platform, such as Canvas, Google Classroom, or Schoology, where your teacher may post lesson recordings. You can also find helpful tutorials on YouTube channels like freeCodeCamp, The Net Ninja, or Traversy Media. In addition, websites like W3Schools and MDN Web Docs offer short videos and examples that explain HTML and CSS concepts clearly.</p>

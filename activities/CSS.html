    <h1>Questions</h1>
<h3>1. Explain the difference between inline, embedded and external CSS?</h3>
 <ol>
    <li>Inline CSS is written directly inside an HTML element's style attribute.</li>
    <li>Embedded CSS is written inside a style tag within the HTML.</li>
    <li>External CSS is stored in a separate .css file and linked with <link> in the <head>.</li>
 </ol>      
    
<h3>2. Explain why you should only use external CSS.</h3>
 <ol>
    <li>Promotes consistency (all pages use the same stylesheet).</li>
    <li>Makes websites easier to maintain (update one file instead of editing many).</li>
    <li>Improves performance (browsers can cache the CSS file).</li>
    <li>Keeps HTML clean and organized (separation of content and design).</li>
 </ol>

 <h3>3. What is a selector used for?</h3>
 <p>A selector tells CSS which HTML elements to style.</p>

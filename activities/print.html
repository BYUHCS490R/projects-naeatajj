      <p>
        Nestled along Oahuâ€™s North Shore, Laie is a place where island culture and spirituality come together beautifully. 
        The town is surrounded by turquoise waves, lush mountains, and friendly faces that make every visitor feel at home. 
        Itâ€™s a reminder that true paradise isnâ€™t just about sceneryâ€”itâ€™s about connection, peace, and gratitude.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether youâ€™re walking through temple gardens or relaxing at Hukilau Beach, Laie offers a feeling of calm that stays with you. 
        The sunsets here are unforgettable, painting the sky with gold and crimson light. 
        Laie reminds me that adventure can be quiet and meaningful, found in every moment we take to breathe and appreciate the beauty around us.

        <h3>Engagement - Page for Print Questions</h3>

        <h4>Q1: Why is the viewport meta tag important?</h4>
        <p>A1: The viewport meta tag helps the webpage adjust correctly to different device widths,
        making the design responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.</p>

        <h4>Q2: How can you adjust the CSS for printing?</h4>
        <p>A2: You can use the <code>@media print</code> rule in your CSS file to create print-specific styles,
        such as removing colors, hiding navigation bars, or changing the font to something
        more printer-friendly like Times New Roman.</p>

        <h4>Q3: When would you want to adjust the CSS for printing?</h4>
        <p>A3: You would adjust CSS for printing when you expect users to print your webpage.
        This ensures the printed version looks clean and readable without background images,
        unnecessary elements, or color-heavy designs.</p>

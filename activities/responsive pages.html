  <!-- QUESTION 1:
       Why do we need a viewport meta tag?
       ANSWER:
       The viewport meta tag makes the web page responsive by telling the browser how to adjust
       the pageâ€™s dimensions and scaling on different screen sizes (like phones or tablets). -->

      <p>
        Nestled along Oahuâ€™s North Shore, Laie is a place where island culture and spirituality come together beautifully.
        The town is surrounded by turquoise waves, lush mountains, and friendly faces that make every visitor feel at home.
        Itâ€™s a reminder that true paradise isnâ€™t just about sceneryâ€”itâ€™s about connection, peace, and gratitude.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether youâ€™re walking through temple gardens or relaxing at Hukilau Beach, Laie offers a feeling of calm that stays with you.
        The sunsets here are unforgettable, painting the sky with gold and crimson light.
        Laie reminds me that adventure can be quiet and meaningful, found in every moment we take to breathe and appreciate the beauty around us.

        <h3>Class Questions & Answers</h3>

        <h4>1. Why do we need a viewport meta tag?</h4>
        <p>
          The viewport meta tag ensures that the page displays correctly on all devices by controlling
          layout scaling and width. Without it, pages often look zoomed-out or distorted on mobile.
        </p>

        <h4>2. When you select the same tag twice, and one has "flex-direction: column;" 
          and the other says "flex-direction: row;", which one takes priority?</h4>
        <p>
          The one that appears last in the CSS file takes priority because of the **cascade** in
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). The most recent rule overrides earlier ones if they target the same element.
        </p>

        <h4>3. How do you change the CSS for a web page displayed on a phone?</h4>
        <p>
          You use a **media query** in your CSS. For example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    font-size: 16px;
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}</code></pre>
        <p>
          This adjusts the page style only when the screen width is 600px or smaller (like on phones).

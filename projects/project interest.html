        <p class="flashier">I like sound systems and audio because they bring music, movies, and games to life in a powerful way. A good sound system creates an immersive experience where I can feel every beat, rhythm, and detail. The clarity and depth of sound make entertainment more exciting and enjoyable, turning an ordinary moment into something memorable.</p>
        
        <p class="flashier">Sound systems also inspire me because they combine both technology and creativity. I enjoy learning how different speakers, amplifiers, and subwoofers work together to produce amazing audio quality. It’s not just about loud music—it’s about appreciating the art of sound and how it connects people through shared experiences.</p>

    <h2 span class="highlight">INTERESTS</h2>
    <p class="flashier">I like to highlight interests that I enjoy doing. I value <mark>spending time with <em>friends</em>, playing video <em>games</em> and enjoying <em>family</em> moments</mark> because these interests bring balance and joy to my life. The friends I have allows me to experience laughter, create long lasting memories, and I feel supported in both good and challenging times. I enjoy video games during my free time because it is where I can relax, have fun and also challenge myself through creativity and strategy. Most importantly, I value Family Time because it strengthens my connection with the people I love most, and reminding me of the importance of love, support and togetherness. These interests are meaningful and special to me because it makes me a person that who treasures relationships, fun and the moments that make life fulfilling.</p>
